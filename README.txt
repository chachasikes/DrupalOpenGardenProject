The Drupal Open Garden Project is creating an installation of Drupal 
that is tailored for individual and community gardeners.

The current name of that project is "Drupal Bloom."

The Drupal Open Garden Project is an open source class for 
beginning developers. Small development projects are created
for the "Bloom" installation by project coordinators in 
various cities.

Students take on these projects during class time. Mentors
work with the students to learn open source development skills
such as version control, patch creation, using code standards,
communicating remotely, and collaborating with other developers.

If this project interests you, please see the website for
application details. We are offering a summer session, and 
will probably offer a winter session as well.
